# FAQ

## What is the acceptance rate of zeus?

Thanks to the ingenius design of the Slice Sampler at the core of the algorithm, zeus has an acceptance rate of exactly 1.

## What are the walkers?

The walkers are like seperate chains exploring the parameter space in parallel. Of course, walkers are not completely independent of each other.

## How many walkers should I use?

As many as possible! But make sure that you use at least twice the number of your parameters.
